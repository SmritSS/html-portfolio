<h1>Top 3 movies according to Smriti</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>
    I love this movie because the imagery and absolute mayhem of a plot is pleasing to my soul.
</p>
<h3>Lord of the rings trilogy</h3>
<p>
    This trilogy is what i watch when im at my lowest and my highest. It is hands down the best way to use 9 hours of your time.
</p>
<h3>Dilwale dulhaniya le jaenge</h3>
<p>
    A movie about love through all odds, an 90's SRK. Need I say more.
